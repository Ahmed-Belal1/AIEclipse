## Problem Description

You are a member of the coast guard force in charge of a rescue boat that goes into the sea to rescue other sinking ships. When rescuing a ship, you need to rescue any living people on it and to retrieve its black box after there are no more passengers thereon to rescue. If a ship sinks completely, it becomes a wreck and you still have to retrieve the black box before it is damaged. Each ship loses one passenger every time step. Additionally, each black box incurs an additional damage point every time step once the ship becomes a wreck. One time step is counted every time an action is performed. You reach your goal when there are no living passengers who are not rescued, there are no undamaged boxes which have not been retrieved, and the rescue boat is not carrying any passengers. You would also like to rescue as many people as possible and retrieve as many black boxes as possible. The area in the sea that you can navigate is an m x n grid of cells where 5 <= m; n <= 15.
#### The grid elements are restricted to the following.
- **Coast Guard Boat**: The coast guard boat is the agent; it is the only element that can move on the grid. The coast guard can enter any cell. It has a fixed capacity 30 <= c <=> 100 which indicates the number of passengers it can carry at one time. So it may have to make multiple visits to one ship to save all the passengers on it.
- **Ships**: Each ship has a certain number of passengers and, at every time step, one of them expires. The ship is considered sunk when all of them are expired or all are picked up In that case, it becomes a wreck. Each ship contains a black box that can be retrieved after it sinks as long as it has not been completely damaged.
- **Wrecks**: Once the ship no longer has any passengers (all expire or all are picked up), it becomes a wreck. When the ship becomes a wreck (once its last passenger either expires or is picked up), in the next time step, the black box starts counting damage from 1 all the way up to 20. Once damage reaches 20, the black box is no longer retrievable.
- **Stations**: Stations are fixed and do not have any capacity limits. To count a passenger saved, they need to be dropped at a station. Initially, the grid is configured as follows.
- The coast guard boat is at a random location
- Several ships are scattered at random locations, and each has a random initial number of passengers p, where 0 < p <= 100.
- Several stations are at random locations.
- There are no wrecks.
- No two items are in the same cell.
#### The coast guard can perform the following actions.
- **Pick-up**: The coast guard picks up as many passengers off a ship as its remaining capacity allows. This can be done on a ship that is in the same cell as the coast guard and it only affects this ship. Once a passenger is picked up by the coast guard, they will not expire and will stay on the coast guard boat until they are dropped at a station.
- **Drop**: The coast guard drops all passengers it is currently carrying at a station. This can only be done when the coast guard and the station are in the same cell and it resets the remaining capacity of the coast guard boat to 0.
- **Retrieve**: The coast guard boat retrieves a black box. This can only be done when the coast guard boat is in the same cell as a wreck with a black box which has not been completely damaged yet. This action does not affect the coast guardâ€™s remaining capacity at all.
- Movement in any of the 4 directions (up, down, left, right) within the grid boundaries.

## Problem Discussion

- The problem is a search problem, we have to find the best path to reach the goal state.
- The problem is a fully observable problem, the agent can see the whole state of the problem.
- The problem is a single agent problem, we have to find the best path for one agent to reach the goal state.
- The agent is the coast guard boat.

To takle the problem we need:-  
- First we need to represent the state of the world including the agent position (i.e. The coast guard boat) at each step.
- In our problem, the state is represented by the position of the coast guard boat in the grid, the number of people on the coast guard boat and the state of the each ship in the grid (i.e. the number of alive people on the ship, is it wrecked and the damage of the blackbox).
- At every step, the agent chooses an action to do and the state changes accordingly until we reach a goal state.
- The goal state is when all the people on the ships are rescued or dead and all blackboxes are retrieved or damaged and can not be retrieved.
- We need to reach the goal state with the minimum deaths and maximum number of blackboxes retrieved.

## Problem Solution

### Search-Tree Node Abstract Data Type.
We created a Node ADT that contains the following attributes *(Not all attributes represent the state of the world, some are used for the algorithms implemented)*:
- **parent**: The parent node of this node.
- **action**: The action that was performed to reach this node from the parent node.
- **depth**: The depth of this node in the search tree.
- **left**: The result state (node) of the acion left of this node.
- **right**: The result state (node) of the acion right of this node.
- **up**: The result state (node) of the acion up of this node.
- **down**: The result state (node) of the acion down of this node.
- **pickUp**: The result state (node) of the acion pickUp of this node.
- **dropoff**: The result state (node) of the acion drop of this node.
- **retrieve**: The result state (node) of the acion retrieve of this node.
- **x**: The x coordinate of the coast guard boat in the grid.
- **y**: The y coordinate of the coast guard boat in the grid.
- **numberOfPeopleOntheCoastGuard**: The number of people on the coast guard boat.
- **ships**: A list of ships with their states in the grid.
- **stations**: A list of stations in the grid.
- **numberOfCollectedBlackboxes**: The number of blackboxes retrieved unitl this node.
- **numberOfdeath**: The number of dead people until this node.
- **nodesExpanded**: The number of nodes expanded until this node.

*The state of the problem is represented by the following attributes:*
- **x**: The x coordinate of the coast guard boat in the grid.
- **y**: The y coordinate of the coast guard boat in the grid.
- **numberOfPeopleOntheCoastGuard**: The number of people on the coast guard boat.
- **ships**: A list of ships with their states in the grid.
  

#### Ship Abstract Data Type.
To represent the state of the ship we created a Ship ADT that contains the following attributes:
- **x**: The x coordinate of the ship in the grid.
- **y**: The y coordinate of the ship in the grid.
- **numberOfPeople**: The number of people on the ship.
- **wreck**: A boolean value that indicates if the ship is wrecked or not.
- **damage**: The damage of the blackbox on the ship.

#### Station Abstract Data Type.
To represent the station we created a Station ADT that contains the following attributes:
- **x**: The x coordinate of the station in the grid.
- **y**: The y coordinate of the station in the grid.
